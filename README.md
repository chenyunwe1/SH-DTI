**The overview of SH-DTI**. (a), The training process of SH-DTI. SH-DTI learns the mapping from low-quality spherical harmonics coefficient maps to high-quality diffusion tensor. (b), Experimental design. Extensive experiments were conducted on both simulated and in-vivo datasets, covering various DTI application scenarios.
